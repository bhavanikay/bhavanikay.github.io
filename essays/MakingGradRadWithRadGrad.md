## A New Perspective
When I used to think about computer science, I would have a mental image of thousands of lines of code for some tech company to use in their newest product, for example a router, but I  never realized how computer science could be used in so many non-technical fields. As someone who has always been extremely interested in social issues, I was really interested to hear about some of the applications and opportunities people are working on. For example, in the introduction video it was mentioned that someone was working on an app that can inform you of your rights in any location. In a world where the law can be unjust, especially towards minority groups, it can be so valuable to have some kind of information on what your rights are as a person in the United States in an emergency, especially because many of us are unaware of these rights as we have not studied law. It may not solve the problem, but it is definitely a helpful resource. I believe that if we continue to build on resources like this, we can hopefully create a world where our devices can greatly reduce the risk of danger. 

## Discovering New Horizons
I know that I have always wanted to go into some kind of management. I believe that although I lack some of the technical skills that my peers may have, I make up for that with my planning and organization skills (although it is important to continue to improve on all aspects). Although somewhat introverted, I have always considered myself a “people-person” and can generally empathize with others and understand their points as well as get my points across effectively. I believe these are all important aspects of management. This is why I was especially interested in the Information Technology Management Association (ITMA) opportunity on RadGrad, as it seemed like something that was right up my alley: creating a bridge between technology and business management. I was also happy to see the Society of Women Engineers at UH Manoa, as this industry is quite male-dominated and organizations like these are making the IT industry much less intimidating for women and encouraging them to partake. Looking through the RadGrad opportunities made me realize that whenever I have an idea (for example, an idea for an app), I should make note of it and continue to build on it because there will most likely be a group of people who would be interested in working on something similar. I was surprised to see how many opportunities there were, and am looking forward to exploring them further and broadening my horizons.


## Don't Miss Out On Any Opportunites!
Overall, RadGrad seems to be a great resource to know what's out there, whether it's an opportunity, a career goal, or a class. It is very helpful to have all of that information in one place. In the past, I feel as if I have missed out on many opportunities (such as joining a club) only because I did not know about them! With RadGrad, I am able to filter through different kinds of opportunities and stay updated on whatever is being offered lately. I also think it's very helpful to be able to see all of the classes in one area as well as seeing their descriptions. This helps me make educated decisions on what classes I would like to take in the future as well as being able to make connections between certain opportunities and classes with my tentative career goal, making me a more well-rounded student. Although I would like to see some more variations of less technical career-goals that are more business/management oriented, I think that it was very helpful and eye-opening to see how many different paths are available to us!
