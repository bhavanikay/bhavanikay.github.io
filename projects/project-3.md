In the case of a zombie apocalypse, it is essential to have your priorities straight. You must know what to avoid (abandoned buildings, fires, and zombies) and what to find. In this game, players get a chance to use their quick thinking and reflexes to drive their car through a zombie apocalypse. They must pick up others who need help while collecting medical kits and other resources at the same time. They must avoid buildings and zombies at all costs. Here is a link to a video of the gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMU1ypQf9JI
