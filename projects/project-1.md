Virtual pets are a source of nostalgia for all of us. Whether it was Tamagotchi, Neopets, Webkinz, etc our beloved virtual friends were always a huge part of our lives. I wanted to bring this experience back with this interactive game. In this game, you can feed the creature and help it grow! Once you feed it enough, you will have successfully raised it into an adult creature and win the game. We took many components to put this game together, such as the background and the design of the creature. It comes with sound effects to know when it is being fed and to enhance the overall experience of the game.
