This banking database allows users to create a new bank record, view  and edit existing records, and delete records if they wish. This database is written in C and uses the following struct for information:

```
struct record
{
    int                accountno;
    char               name[25];
    char               address[80];
    struct record*     next;
};
    
```

Although it is on the simpler side, it is simple to add more functionalities to this database. Banking has never looked so easy before!
